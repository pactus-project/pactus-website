Why investing in Pactus: stake to support decentralization,
participate in long-term growth, and explore strategic opportunities for enterprises.
"""
+++

Pactus is a layer-1 blockchain built for true decentralization, combining security with exceptional efficiency.
It introduces [Solid State Proof-of-Stake (SSPoS)](https://docs.pactus.org/protocol/consensus/proof-of-stake/)
to keep validation open and resistant to concentration, supports
[ultra-low-resource](https://docs.pactus.org/get-started/become-a-validator/#minimum-requirements)
validator nodes that can run on a wide range of devices—from standard Windows PCs to
small single-board computers like Raspberry Pi—and enables
[zero-fee transactions](https://docs.pactus.org/tutorials/zero-fee-transactions/)
for a simpler, more accessible user experience.

Whether you’re an individual looking to stake or an organization exploring strategic exposure,
**Pactus stands out for its fundamentally different approach, and that difference matters.**

## For individuals

### Stake to help secure the network

Pactus uses a real Proof-of-Stake consensus that enables anyone to participate as a validator by staking PAC.
By [staking on a validator node](https://docs.pactus.org/get-started/become-a-validator/),
you contribute to network security and decentralization while earning protocol rewards for your contribution.

### Build a personal long-term position

Many individuals view Pactus as a long-term technology investment built on clear, verifiable fundamentals:

- **Decentralization-first design**: Pactus deliberately removes delegation,
  requiring each validator to participate directly.
  This ensures validation remains distributed and helps prevent power concentration.
- **Clear, open-source development**: The protocol is fully open source under
  [MIT license](https://github.com/pactus-project/pactus/blob/main/LICENSE),
  developed in public with a strong focus on testing, quality, and regular, well-documented releases.
- **Sandbox dApps**: Pactus is developing a decentralized file system solution for sandbox dApps;
  isolated applications running on top of the Pactus chain.
- **Growing ecosystem**: Pactus continues to expand its ecosystem with integrations that
  support adoption on new platforms while engaging both the community and developers.

### Traction & Network Growth

Pactus isn’t theoretical—its mainnet has been
[live since January 2024](https://pactus.org/2024/01/24/mainnet-launched/),
with measurable and growing adoption.

### Network Fundamentals

- Thousands of active validators are securing the network
- Millions of transactions processed
- High throughput demonstrated in testing

### Why these Compounds

Each validator strengthens network security.
[Cross-chain](https://wrapto.app) interoperability ensures PAC holders aren’t locked into a single ecosystem.
They can access liquidity and DeFi across multiple major networks.
Pactus has passed the cold-start phase, and the infrastructure for continued growth is already in place.

## For enterprises and organizations

### Strategic Allocation

Pactus has a [coin allocation](https://pactus.org/about/faq/#economy.coin_allocation)
for strategic partners and institutional participants seeking
meaningful exposure with direct alignment to protocol growth.

Unlocking these allocation provides:

- **Direct collaboration with the Pactus team** for technical diligence and ongoing coordination
- **Structured participation options**, such as vesting schedules or volume pricing, are unavailable on the open market
- **Aligned incentives**, investments are used directly for development, infrastructure, and ecosystem growth

This mechanism is designed for enterprises, and strategic partners looking for a long-term position in
foundational blockchain infrastructure.

**The goal is simple**: when more credible partners and real-world products use Pactus,
the network becomes more useful and resilient, creating stronger long-term alignment for investors, builders, and users.

### Profitable Investment

Organizations may view Pactus as an opportunity because:

- **Early infrastructure upside**: foundational networks can see compounding value as adoption grows
- **Transparent execution**: open development, public releases, and measurable network progress
- **Decentralization as a moat**: resilient networks can attract long-term builders and users
