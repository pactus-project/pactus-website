Pactus is an open-source platform that thrives on the contributions of its community.
Whether you're a developer, designer, or enthusiast, your contribution can truly make a difference.

Here are various ways you can support the Pactus project:

## Run a Node

One of the most effective ways to contribute to the Pactus network is by running a node.
A "node" is a software program that downloads a copy of the Pactus blockchain and
ensure the network keeps running safe and decentralized.

These guides can help you to run and configure your node:

- [Run Pactus in Graphic Mode](https://docs.pactus.org/get-started/pactus-gui)
- [Run Pactus in Command Line Mode](https://docs.pactus.org/get-started/pactus-daemon)
- [Run Pactus using Docker](https://docs.pactus.org/get-started/pactus-docker)

## Become a Validator

Validators play an important role in the Pactus blockchain by verifying transactions and
adding them to the blockchain.
By becoming a validator, you can earn [rewards](https://docs.pactus.org/protocol/blockchain/incentive/)
for contributing to the network's security and decentralization.

To become a validator, you will need to stake a certain amount of Pactus coins.
These guides can help you to send a Bond transaction and stake some coins:
