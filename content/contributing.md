Pactus is an open-source platform that thrives on the contributions of its community.
Whether you're a developer, designer, or enthusiast, your involvement can truly make a difference.

Here are some of the ways you can support the Pactus project:

## Run a Node

One of the most effective ways to contribute to the Pactus network is by running a node.
A "node" is a software program that downloads a copy of the Pactus blockchain and
helps ensure the network stays secure, reliable, and decentralized.

These guides will help you run and configure your node:

- [Run Pactus in Graphic Mode](https://docs.pactus.org/get-started/pactus-gui)
- [Run Pactus in Command Line Mode](https://docs.pactus.org/get-started/pactus-daemon)
- [Run Pactus using Docker](https://docs.pactus.org/get-started/pactus-docker)

## Become a Validator

Validators play a crucial role in the Pactus blockchain by verifying transactions and
adding them to the blockchain.
By becoming a validator, you can earn [rewards](https://docs.pactus.org/protocol/blockchain/incentive/)
for contributing to the networkâ€™s security and decentralization.

To become a validator, you will need to stake a certain amount of Pactus coins.
These guides can help you send a Bond transaction and stake your coins:

- [How to use Pactus Wallet](https://docs.pactus.org/tutorials/pactus-wallet)

## Contribute to the Testnet

The Pactus testnet provides a safe environment for experimenting with new features,
testing applications, and improving the network before changes go live on mainnet.
Contributing to the testnet helps strengthen the stability of Pactus and accelerates development.

Here are some ways to get involved:

- Run a node on the testnet to help maintain stability.
- Test new releases and report bugs or unexpected behavior.
- Provide feedback on new features and improvements.
- Join community discussions and share your testnet experience.

Check out the [Testnet Documentation](https://docs.pactus.org/tutorials/pactus-testnet/)
for setup instructions and details on how you can participate.

## Development

Pactus is an open-source project that welcomes and encourages contributions from developers.
By contributing to the codebase, you can help improve the Pactus platform and build new features that
benefit the entire ecosystem.
