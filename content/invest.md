Pactus is a layer-1 blockchain designed to be **accessible**, **secure**, and **highly decentralized**.
Whether you’re an individual looking to stake or an organization exploring strategic exposure, this page summarizes why Pactus is worth your attention.

## For individuals: stake and invest with purpose

### Stake to help secure the network

Pactus uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus that enables anyone to participate as a validator by staking PAC.
By staking, you contribute to network security and decentralization while earning protocol rewards for your contribution.

### Build a personal long-term position

Many individuals see Pactus as a long-term technology investment:

- **Decentralization-first design**: Pactus aims to keep validation open and distributed, helping prevent power concentration.
- **Growing ecosystem**: As tooling, wallets, exchanges, and community adoption expand, utility and demand can grow over time.
- **Clear, open-source development**: Protocol improvements and releases are public, auditable, and community-driven.

### Why Pactus can grow

Pactus focuses on practical adoption: easy-to-run nodes, clear documentation, and an active open-source community.
As network participation increases (validators, developers, integrations), the chain becomes stronger and more valuable as a public infrastructure.

Growth also compounds as **more third parties adopt Pactus**: exchanges and liquidity venues, wallets, explorers, analytics, and—most importantly—new tools and applications built on top of the network. Each new integration makes Pactus easier to use, increases real-world utility, and can attract the next wave of users and builders.

## For enterprises and organizations: strategic investment & ecosystem alignment

### VC fund reserve and long-term alignment

Pactus is structured to support sustainable growth and ecosystem development. A dedicated **VC fund reserve** helps us attract and work with **VCs, strategic partners, and enterprises** by funding the activities that make the network easier to adopt and build on.

This reserve can be used to:

- **Activate strategic partnerships (we’re in the market now)**: accelerate integrations, co-marketing and go-to-market execution, and enterprise pilot deployments
- **Support builders and infrastructure**: wallets, explorers, developer tooling, and critical ecosystem services
- **Improve market access and liquidity**: listings, liquidity programs, and broader ecosystem visibility

The goal is simple: when more credible partners and real-world products use Pactus, the network becomes more useful and resilient—creating stronger long-term alignment for investors, builders, and users.

### Why investment in Pactus can be profitable

Organizations may view Pactus as an opportunity because:

- **Early infrastructure upside**: foundational networks can see compounding value as adoption grows
- **Transparent execution**: open development, public releases, and measurable network progress
- **Decentralization as a moat**: resilient networks can attract long-term builders and users
