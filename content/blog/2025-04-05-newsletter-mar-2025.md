## Pactus Highlights

Welcome to the March 2025 edition of the Pactus Newsletter.
We are excited to share several groundbreaking updates that mark significant progress for the Pactus ecosystem.
From new partnerships to technical advancements,
these developments reflect our shared commitment to building a stronger, more accessible decentralized future.

### Welcome to ezeX: Our Official Exchange Name!

After an enthusiastic community naming contest, we are proud to
introduce ezeX as the official name of our upcoming exchange.
We extend our deepest gratitude to everyone who participated in the contest,
and congratulations to the winner, who received 200 USDT as a token of appreciation.
ezeX represents more than just a trading platform, it embodies our vision for a
seamless, secure, and efficient trading experience.

### Pactus Crowdfund: Your Chance to Shape the Future

The Pactus Crowdfund is live now.
This initiative presents a unique opportunity for early supporters to acquire $PAC at preferential rates.
We note with appreciation that 60% of the available allocation has already been committed,
demonstrating strong community confidence in Pactus' long-term vision.
Interested participants may contribute through “Pagu”
on [Discord](http://discord.gg/pactus) or
[Telegram](https://t.me/pactus_pagu_bot) with the `crowdfund` commands.

### Pactus Expands to Binance Smart Chain

We are thrilled to announce the launch of Wrapped PAC (WPAC) on Binance Smart Chain (BSC),
this is another step to enhance the accessibility of Pactus and its ecosystem.
Users can now hold [WPAC](https://bscscan.com/token/0x10004a9A742ec135c686C9aCed00FA3C93D66866)
in MetaMask or Trust Wallet for convenient asset management, trade effortlessly on
[PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/),
and bridge PAC to Binance Smart Chain using
[Wrapto](https://wrapto.app/) (while carefully following all instructions).

To safeguard investor confidence, initial liquidity has been locked for one year on Team Finance.

### New Partnership: Pactus x Cryptopia
