## Pactus Highlights

Welcome to the July 2025 edition of the Pactus Newsletter.
Here‚Äôs everything you need to know about what‚Äôs been happening in July.
From major updates to ongoing community campaigns.

## Pactus 1.8.0 (Paris) Released!

On July 1st, 2025, we officially released
[Pactus Version 1.8.0 (Paris)](https://pactus.org/2025/07/01/pactus-1.8.0-paris-released/).

This release introduces one of the most requested features:
Batch Transfer, as proposed in PIP-39. With Batch Transfers,
users can now send multiple transactions in a single payload, significantly improving efficiency.

- üóìÔ∏è Activation Block: Batch Transfer will be activated at block number 4,800,000.
- üîÅ Upgrade Recommended: All validators and node operators are
  strongly encouraged to upgrade their nodes as soon as possible.

Starting with version 1.8.0, the Windows version of Pactus is now code-signed via a
certificate issued by the [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/).

## In Review: New PIP Proposals

We're currently reviewing two new PIP drafts. Your feedback and engagement are welcome!

- [PIP-41: URI Scheme](https://pips.pactus.org/PIPs/pip-41):
  A proposed standardized URI scheme for Pactus to make wallet interactions smoother.
- [PIP-42: Address Recovery](https://pips.pactus.org/PIPs/pip-42):
  A mechanism to help users recover addresses in certain cases.

Feel free to join the discussion and help shape the future of Pactus.
