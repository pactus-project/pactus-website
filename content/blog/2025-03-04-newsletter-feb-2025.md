## Pactus Highlights

Welcome to the February 2025 edition of the Pactus Newsletter.
As we step into the holy month of Ramadan, we extend our heartfelt wishes to
our Muslim community members for a blessed and peaceful time. May this sacred month bring you spiritual fulfillment,
renewed strength, and abundant blessings. Let us all embrace this opportunity to
foster greater understanding, compassion, and unity within our diverse community.

### Wrapped PAC (WPAC) Now Live on Uniswap

To address ongoing centralized exchange issues, Pactus has launched Wrapped PAC (WPAC) on Uniswap with
liquidity locked for 1 year.

Features:

- Trade WPAC/WPOL on Polygon.
- Bridge PAC to Polygon using [Wrapto](https://wrapto.app/).
- Official contract address:
  [0x2f77E0afAEE06970Bf860B8267b5aFECFFF6F216](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x2f77E0afAEE06970Bf860B8267b5aFECFFF6F216).
- This move marks a significant step toward decentralized trading and Web3 integration for Pactus.

### Pactus Now Live on TradeOgre

PAC/USDT trading is now available on [TradeOgre.com](https://tradeogre.com/), thanks to community member
[Thanos](https://x.com/Thanos8912).
Users are encouraged to conduct their own due diligence before trading.

### Partnership Announcement: Neova x Pactus

Pactus has partnered with [Neova Protocol](https://neova.io/) to enhance decentralized storage and scalability.
This collaboration aims to integrate Neova’s DePIN-powered data management with Pactus’s leaderless consensus mechanism,
paving the way for innovative Web3 solutions.

### Xeggex Incident and PIP-38

In early February, Pactus faced a challenging situation regarding the Xeggex exchange.
The platform became unavailable, leaving user assets inaccessible,
while suspicious transactions were observed moving funds from Xeggex’s main wallets to other exchanges.
Announcements from the Xeggex team lacked clarity and failed to provide adequate reassurance to users.
The Pactus team has been closely monitoring the situation and has proposed
[PIP-38](https://pips.pactus.org/PIPs/pip-38),
a mechanism to monitor and freeze the Xeggex deposit address to prevent malicious movement of PAC coins.

Further Actions:

- Community upgrade request issued for
  [Pactus 1.7.1](https://pactus.org/2025/02/10/important-announcement-regarding-xeggex-exploit/) to implement PIP-38.
- A community [poll](https://x.com/PactusChain/status/1893327634735530267)
  was conducted to decide on unfreezing Xeggex funds, with withdrawals now reopened.
- Trading has now opened again but please exercise caution.

### Web Wallet Development

We are thrilled to announce that a fully client-based
[Web Wallet](https://github.com/pactus-project/pactus-wallet) is currently in development.
This wallet will be accessible across all devices, including mobile and desktop, and will support multiple browsers.
Unlike most wallets, the Pactus Web Wallet will be entirely open source, with all data,
including seeds and private keys, stored locally on users’ devices.
No servers will be involved, ensuring maximum security, privacy, and user control.
This groundbreaking innovation will empower users to easily create, recover,
and manage their Pactus wallets from anywhere.
Sending and receiving transactions will be effortless, providing a seamless experience for all Pactus users.

### Building a New Exchange

As previously [announced](https://pactus.org/2025/02/10/we-are-building-an-exchange-a-different-one/),
Pactus is starting an exciting new project: building a new exchange.
This decision comes from our trust in the skills of the Pactus development team and the strong support of our community.
Our primary focus is assembling a dedicated team to lead the development of the exchange.
While this is a considerable challenge, Pactus remains our foremost priority, and its development will continue
to receive our complete attention and dedication. We remain committed in our mission to build a robust,
community-driven blockchain that aligns with the vision of Pactus.
