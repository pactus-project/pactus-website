## Pactus Highlights

August has been a defining month for Pactus.
From a community-approved governance proposal to continued validator growth,
the network has taken big strides toward sustainability and long-term trust.
Alongside these milestones, validator growth and educational initiatives kept the ecosystem vibrant and engaged.

## PIP-43: Block Reward Split

This month, the community came together to decide on [PIP-43: Split Rewards](https://pips.pactus.org/PIPs/pip-43),
a proposal to introduce a **70/30 block reward split** to Validators and to the Pactus Foundation.

- On August 22, a community call was held on Discord where members voiced their opinions.
  The proposal received broad support and officially passed.

- To put it into practice, a trial fork was activated on Testnet, enabling the new reward model.

- This upgrade ensures validator incentives remain strong while also providing predictable,
  transparent funding for the foundation’s operations and ecosystem growth.

- It also prolongs the overall reward duration from six years to ten years, extending sustainability for the long term.

## Network Growth

The Pactus network continues to expand, with over 4,500 validators and counting.
This milestone reinforces Pactus position as one of the most decentralized blockchains in the world,
ensuring resilience, fairness, and security.

## Looking Back: How Far We’ve Come

August also marks a year since two important milestones in Pactus history:

- PIP-31: Consumptional Fee Model introduced a fairer and more efficient transaction fee structure.

- Python SDK Launch gave developers the tools to easily interact with the blockchain,
  from creating transactions to generating keys. [Explore here](https://pypi.org/project/pactus-sdk/).

## Looking Ahead: What’s Next for September and Beyond

September will focus on monitoring the PIP-43 trial fork,
ensuring progress on Testnet for a smooth and confident implementation to mainnet.

We’ll also:

- Engage the community in further governance discussions.
- Continue strengthening educational outreach.
- Release more details on the mainnet activation block.
- Introduce a more robust Pactus GUI to enhance user experience.
- Advance discussions with a global exchange to list Pactus for easier trading and wider access

These steps set the stage for the next chapter of Pactus growth.

## Closing Note

From fee models and SDKs in 2024 to governance and sustainability in 2025,
the Pactus journey shows a clear trajectory: building a blockchain that is clean, credible, and community-driven.

Thank you to our validators, developers, and community members for making this progress possible.
