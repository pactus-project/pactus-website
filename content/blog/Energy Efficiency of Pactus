Through our innovative architecture and operational mechanisms, Pactus demonstrates remarkable energy efficiency.​ Pactus blockchain has the strength to utilize low-power devices, such as Raspberry Pi Zero, which consumes only 2 watts of power. This contrasts with traditional blockchain networks, which depend on energy-intensive mining rigs and high-specification servers. 

By integrating personal computers and shared Virtual Private Servers (VPS), Pactus ensures a balance between energy efficiency and high performance, thereby minimizing the environmental impact and fostering a more democratic network participation model.

## What is SSPoS
The SSPoS consensus model adopted by Pactus is essential to its energy-efficient framework. This model includes a fixed committee of 51 validators that changes over time, limiting the number of participants and reducing the volume of messages exchanged during the consensus process—such restrictions effectively lower energy consumption while ensuring robust security and scalable operations. 

## Understanding Sortition Algorithm 
The Sortition Algorithm is a cornerstone of Pactus, enabling the equitable and randomized selection of validators for the committee. By leveraging a VRF, the algorithm generates a random value between 0 and the total staked coins. Validators qualify for committee membership if their assigned number falls below their stake. Upon including their sortition transaction in a block, they replace the longest-serving committee member.

Pactus leverages pruned nodes to significantly reduce storage needs by retaining only the last 10 days of blocks. This streamlined approach enables new validators to sync in approximately 15 minutes, enhancing accessibility for users with lower-end hardware and expanding participation. Moreover, we incorporate an optimized messaging system with ten simplified message types and deterministic serialization, effectively reducing network traffic and computational demands.
