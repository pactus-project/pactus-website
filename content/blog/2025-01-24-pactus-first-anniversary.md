## One Year Pactus

Pactus [began](https://pactus.org/2024/01/24/mainnet-launched/) with a dream,
a dream to reshape blockchain technology and make it accessible to everyone.
This vision has inspired us to build a platform that empowers people and
communities everywhere to make this dream a reality.

Today, we celebrate our first anniversary.
It’s been an incredible journey, and this milestone is a testament to the hard work,
dedication, and collaboration of our team and community.

## A Year of Achievements

The past year has been a journey of growth and progress for Pactus.
We’ve faced challenges, overcome obstacles, and celebrated many milestones along the way.
We’ve built a seamless consensus engine, onboarded over 4,000 validators, overcome two major attacks,
enabled gas-less transactions, implemented simplified pruning for nodes, and more.
These achievements are a testament to the resilience and dedication of our team and community.

In the past year, we released seven major versions, each adding new features and improving the platform.
These updates have brought us closer to our goal of
building a strong and scalable platform for decentralized applications.

We’ve built something truly special, and the journey has only just begun.
Our achievements so far have set the stage for even greater things to come.

## The Road Ahead

While we celebrate our achievements, we are aware of the challenges ahead.
There will be ups and downs along the way.
The path is not without obstacles, but our faith in Pactus’ vision keeps us moving forward.
We know that what we have started is not easy, but we are firmer in our commitment to our vision.

Pactus will be a trusted platform for decentralized Layer-2 applications,
and we will provide a seamless framework for everyone to use
Pactus to address real-life issues. This is the vision of Pactus.

## Gratitude to Our Community

At the heart of Pactus is its community.
You are the builders, the believers, and the backbone of everything we do.
Together, we are creating a world where trustless systems empower individuals and reshape industries.
We thank you for your unwavering support, your ideas, and your trust.

Pactus is where the community builds trustless systems — and this is just the beginning.

Here’s to another year of dreaming big, building boldly, and creating a decentralized future.

Happy First Anniversary, Pactus!
