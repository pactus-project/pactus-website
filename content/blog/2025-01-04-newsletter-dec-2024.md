## Pactus Highlights

Welcome to the December 2024 edition of the Pactus Newsletter[^1].
As we step into 2025, we want to take a moment to thank every one of you for being a part of the Pactus journey.
Your unwavering support and belief in our vision have made 2024 an extraordinary year for our project.
We are excited to continue building the future of blockchain together.
Here’s to another year of innovation, growth, and milestones—let’s make 2025 even better!

### Forbes & Bybit

December brought remarkable achievements! Pactus is now listed on
[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/digital-assets/assets/pactus-pac/),
one of the most prestigious platforms for business and technology, highlighting our innovation and impact.
Simultaneously, [Bybit](https://www.bybitglobal.com/en/coin-price/pactus/),
a top centralized exchange, added live tracking and project information for Pactus.
While $PAC isn’t tradable on Bybit yet, this progress signifies growing recognition and potential partnerships.
Together, these milestones demonstrate our increasing prominence in the blockchain space.

### Community Creations: Empowering Collaboration

Our incredible community has stepped up with fantastic contributions this month:

- [Network Health Charts](https://1pactus.github.io/en-us/):
  These provide detailed insights into Pactus’s activity, including staking trends and supply distribution.
  A big thank-you to our community members who made this possible!

- [Validator Relationship Graphs](https://1pactus.github.io/en-us/docs/relationship/relationship_30/):
  This tool visualizes connections between validators, offering transparency and
  fostering collaboration within the network. A huge shoutout to our community member Guan Guan for this valuable addition.

Tools like these underscore the power of community-driven innovation and
remind us that we’re building something amazing together.

### 7 Million Transactions

What a way to end the year! Pactus achieved 1 million transactions in December alone,
bringing our total to an impressive 7 million transactions since the mainnet launch.
This rapid growth showcases the adoption of our technology and the strength of our network.

### Version 1.6.4 (Mumbai) Released

This month, we rolled out [Pactus 1.6.4](https://github.com/pactus-project/pactus/releases/tag/v1.6.4),
a vital patch for the networking issues caused by the replay attack.
With this update, the network is more secure and performs better than ever.
If you haven’t upgraded yet, now is the time to do so for optimal performance and safety.

### Pactus Notification System Underway

Development on [PIP-36](https://pips.pactus.org/PIPs/pip-36): ZeroMQ Notification Service is in full swing!
Once implemented, this feature will enable real-time notifications for developers,
empowering them to build dApps that interact seamlessly with the Pactus blockchain.
Stay tuned for more updates as we make progress.

### Pagu Goes Global

[Pagu](https://github.com/pagu-project/pagu/), our interactive bot, has been fully integrated into
[Telegram](https://t.me/pactus_pagu_bot),
making blockchain interaction even more accessible.
But we’re not stopping there—future plans include WhatsApp integration and a dedicated Pagu website,
cementing Pactus with a multi-platform interactive bot.

[^1]: The Pactus monthly newsletter is published on our website and
distributed to subscribers via email during the first week of each month.
It recaps key highlights and important news from the previous month.
