## New Year. New Momentum. Stronger Network

As we step into 2026, Pactus isn't just celebrating another month, we're
celebrating two full years of proving that blockchain can be different. Two
years of unwavering commitment to simplicity, efficiency, and true
decentralization. Two years of building something that actually matters.

While others spent 2024 and 2025 chasing hype cycles, Pactus stayed focused on
the fundamentals. And you know what? It worked. The network is stronger than
ever, the community is more engaged than ever, and 2026 is already shaping up
to be our most transformative year yet.

Let's dive into what kicked off this incredible year.

## Tokyo Has Landed: Pactus v1.11.0

On January 25, we released
**[Pactus v1.11.0 (Tokyo)](https://pactus.org/2026/01/25/pactus-1.11.0-tokyo-released/)**,
marking the first major software release of 2026. And what a way to start the
year.

Tokyo brings stability improvements, critical bug fixes, and internal
optimizations that make running a Pactus node smoother than ever.

For those wondering what's new in Tokyo, here's the quick version:

- Enhanced stability mechanisms to keep nodes running reliably
- Bug fixes based on real-world testnet feedback
- Internal code optimizations that improve performance without changing how
  you interact with the network
- Improved node synchronization for faster blockchain updates

If you haven't upgraded yet, now's the time. Head over to the
**[download page](https://pactus.org/download)** and get v1.11.0 running. Your
node will thank you.

## Two Years by the Numbers

January 24, 2026, marked exactly two years since that first block was created.
Pactus didn't just survive, it thrived. The network grew stronger. The
community grew larger. The technology grew more refined. And we did it all
while staying true to the principles that made Pactus special in the first
place.

Let's take a moment to appreciate how far we've come since January 24, 2024,
when the Pactus Mainnet first came alive.

**730 days of uptime.** That's two full years without a single network failure,
no emergency shutdowns, no catastrophic bugs that required rolling back the
blockchain. Just steady, reliable operation day after day.

**5,000+ active validators.** Every single one of these validators represents
someone who chose to be part of Pactus. Someone who set up a node, staked their
PAC, and started securing the network. This is what decentralization looks like
in practice.

**0 compromises made.** We said we'd build a blockchain that's simple,
efficient, and sustainable. We said anyone could validate without needing
expensive hardware or delegating stake to pools. We said we'd prioritize
community governance over corporate control. Two years later, we haven't
compromised on any of it.

**100% community-driven vision.** From PIP proposals to release naming votes
to testnet feedback loops, every major decision involves the people who run the
network. Not a board of directors. Not venture capital investors. Just You!

Decentralization isn't just about the protocol, it's about the people. And
Pactus has some of the best.

### What Makes This Anniversary Different from Others?

Most blockchain projects celebrate anniversaries by talking about their market
cap, their funding rounds, their celebrity endorsements, or their partnerships
with Fortune 500 companies. Pactus celebrates something different: consistency.

- **Consistency over hype:** While others chased trends, Pactus delivered
  steady, predictable releases focused on fundamentals
- **Community-first always:** From codename voting to testnet feedback loops,
  every decision involves the people who run the network
- **Sustainable by design:** Two years of proving that energy-efficient
  consensus isn't a compromise, it's the smarter path forward

## What's Under the Hood: Protocol Development

Let's talk about what the development team has been working on behind the
scenes.

The first Pactus software cycle of 2026 officially kicked off in early January.
This means the development team is already planning and building features for
the next release after Tokyo. Roadmap priorities for the year ahead include:

- **Protocol resilience features** to make the network even more robust
- **Usability enhancements** to make running a node easier for non-technical
  users
- **Ecosystem expansion tools** to help developers build on Pactus

## Looking Ahead: The Rest of 2026

If January is any indication, 2026 is going to be extraordinary.

Here's a sneak peek at what's coming (note: these are high-level directions,
more details will be shared in upcoming newsletters and community town halls):

**Q1 2026:** Tokyo stable release rollout, enhanced documentation, community
tooling improvements

**Q2-Q3 2026:** Protocol resilience features, usability enhancements, ecosystem
expansion initiatives

**Q4 2026:** Year-end optimizations, preparing for 2027 roadmap, community
retrospectives

But here's the thing: roadmaps are great, but what really matters is execution.
And Pactus has proven, release after release, that we deliver.

## How You Can Contribute Right Now

Pactus is only as strong as its community. Here's how you can help make 2026
even better:

**Test the latest releases.** When release candidates drop, spin up a test node
and report any issues. Your feedback makes the final releases better.

**Vote in governance polls.** Whether it's choosing release codenames or voting
on protocol improvements, your voice matters. Use it.

**Run a node.** Every validator strengthens the network. Whether you're staking
1 PAC or 1,000 PAC, you're contributing to decentralization.

**Join the conversation.** Discord, Twitter/X, GitHub, wherever you're
comfortable, join the discussions. Share ideas. Ask questions. Help newcomers.
Build the community.

**Help with documentation and translations.** Not everyone speaks English. Not
everyone understands technical jargon. If you can help make Pactus more
accessible, you're doing crucial work.

Every contribution matters. Every voice counts.

## Thank You

Two years. 730 days. Over 5,000 validators. Countless community members.
Hundreds of contributors.

None of this happens without you.

To every tester who caught a bug before it reached production. To every
validator securing the network block after block. To every community member
answering questions and welcoming newcomers. To every developer building on
Pactus. To every believer who saw the vision and decided to be part of it.

Thank you.

As we celebrated our
**[first anniversary](https://pactus.org/2025/01/24/pactus-at-one-from-dream-to-reality/)**
in January 2025, we looked back at an incredible first year. Now, one year
later, we're not just looking back, we're looking forward. Because the best is
yet to come.

Here's to sustainable consensus. Here's to community-first development. Here's
to never compromising on what matters.

**Here's to two years down and a lifetime of innovation ahead.**

Welcome to 2026. Let's make it count.
