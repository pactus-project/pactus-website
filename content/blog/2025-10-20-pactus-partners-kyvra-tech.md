# Pactus Partners with Kyvra Tech

The Pactus Foundation has officially partnered with [Kyvra Tech](https://kyvra.xyz) under its FUSION Program to develop the **Pactus Nodes Tracker**—an open-source system built to monitor, analyze, and visualize the Pactus network in real time.

This collaboration represents more than just a technical milestone; it’s a bold step toward deepening transparency, decentralization, and community participation within the Pactus ecosystem.

By empowering both developers and community members to see network health, node activity, and connectivity across the globe, the Pactus Nodes Tracker will make the inner workings of the network more visible, auditable, and accessible than ever.

As part of Pactus’s mission to build a truly open Layer-1 protocol, the tracker ensures that every participant—from node operators to curious newcomers—can independently verify network conditions and contribute to maintaining a healthy, decentralized infrastructure.

The project will be developed in four key phases, culminating in a set of public APIs for open integration and data access. This aligns with the broader FUSION initiative, which supports builders and open-source contributors developing essential tools for the Pactus ecosystem.

## 🧭 Project Overview

Under this agreement, Kyvra Tech will build the tracker in four structured phases:



1. **Bootstrap Node Health:** Monitor bootstrap nodes, score connectivity, and display daily health status.
2. **Reachable Nodes:** Detect and visualize reachable nodes on a map with charts and public node lists.
3. **Node Crawler:** Develop a crawler based on the [Nebula](https://github.com/dennis-tra/nebula) project, a decentralized peer-to-peer network crawler, to gather detailed network data.
4. **Public APIs:** Provide and document public [JSON-RPC APIs](https://tracker.kyvra.xyz/json-rpc) for developers and third-party integrations.



## 🧩 What Is Nebula?



The [Nebula](https://github.com/dennis-tra/nebula) project is an open-source crawler originally developed to explore and analyze peer-to-peer networks built on libp2p. By adapting Nebula’s methodology, the Pactus Nodes Tracker will achieve high-fidelity insights into node distribution, uptime, and connectivity, enabling a transparent view of the entire network topology.



## 💰 Grant Agreement Details



* The total grant of **20,000 PAC** will be distributed in four equal installments of **5,000 PAC** following the successful completion of each phase.
* All code and documentation will be publicly released under the **MIT License**, ensuring full community accessibility and open collaboration.
* You can follow development progress here: [github.com/kyvra-tech/pactus-nodes-tracker](https://github.com/kyvra-tech/pactus-nodes-tracker).
