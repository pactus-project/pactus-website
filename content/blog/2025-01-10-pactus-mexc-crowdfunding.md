We are excited to announce our first crowdfunding campaign aimed at raising funds for two pivotal initiatives,
listing on the [MEXC](https://www.mexc.com) exchange and adding liquidity to Wrapped PAC on Polygon.
These steps not only enhance the accessibility of PAC but also allow us to add to our already robust ecosystem.

## Why We're Crowdfunding

### Listing on MEXC Exchange

One of the primary goals of our crowdfunding campaign is to secure a listing on the MEXC exchange.
This will dramatically increase the visibility and accessibility of PAC,
making it easier for users to trade and invest.
MEXC is known for its user-friendly interface and a wide array of supported cryptocurrencies,
which makes it an ideal platform for Pactus to flourish. By securing this listing,
we aim to attract a broader audience and foster a more vibrant trading environment for our token.

### Adding Liquidity to Wrapped PAC on Polygon

The second focus of our fundraising efforts is to add liquidity to
[Wrapped PAC](https://wrapto.app/) on the Polygon network.
By enabling Wrapped PAC, we allow users to hold PAC in their EVM-based wallets,
paving the way for seamless transactions and interactions within the growing Web3 ecosystem.
This move significantly opens the doors for investment opportunities for Web3 investors,
making PAC a more attractive option as it becomes easier to use and trade.

### How You Can Contribute

We aim to raise a total of 150,000 USDT through this crowdfunding campaign. Participating
in this opportunity is straightforward and accessible to everyone.
You can order packages through our in-house bot, [Pagu](https://github.com/pagu-project/pagu/),
available on both Discord and Telegram.
Payments are made effortlessly through [NowPayments](https://nowpayments.io/), ensuring a smooth transaction process.
Once your payment is confirmed, you can quickly claim your PAC through the Pagu.

### Benefits for Supporters

Participants in this crowdfunding initiative have the exciting opportunity to earn a remarkable return of up to
120% PAC within the first year by utilizing your purchase to become a validator on Pactus.
This potential return is calculated based on the prevailing network difficulty,
which reflects the current state of the Pactus ecosystem and its growth potential.
By engaging in this crowdfunding campaign, supporters not only contribute to the development of Pactus but
also stand to benefit significantly from their investment.
This is an ideal opportunity for those looking to explore innovative investment options in the cryptocurrency space.

We also encourage you to share our crowdfunding initiative with anyone in your network
who may be interested in investing in innovative projects like Pactus.
Whether they are seasoned investors or newcomers to the cryptocurrency world,
this effort offers a unique opportunity to be part of something transformative.
By introducing Pactus to potential supporters, you can help us expand our community and
foster a collaborative environment that propels our project forward.
