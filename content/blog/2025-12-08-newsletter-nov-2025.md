## Pactus Highlights

November has been a month of expansion and innovation for the Pactus ecosystem.
From new ways to stay connected to community driven applications, the network is
becoming more accessible and vibrant.

### Pagu on WhatsApp

We are excited to announce that **[Pagu](https://pagu.bot/)**, our helpful community bot, is now
available on **WhatsApp**! This integration brings Pactus updates, network
stats, and alerts directly to your favorite messaging app.

Staying connected with the Pactus network has never been easier. You can now
interact and query network status without leaving
WhatsApp. This is part of our ongoing effort to make Pactus accessible to
everyone, everywhere.

### Wrapto Bridge: Bridging the Gap

**[Wrapto](https://wrapto.app)** is now live, enabling Pactus users to seamlessly bridge their PAC into other major blockchain ecosystems in the form of Wrapped PAC (WPAC). This unlocks new liquidity, interoperability, and utility for the Pactus community.

The team continues to enhance security, stability, and user experience across the platform. Expect further improvements, feature updates, and expanded chain support as Wrapto evolves.

### Secutor: Enter the Arena

We also saw the launch of **[Secutor](https://secutor.world/)**, a new
community-developed application on Pactus! Secutor is a decentralized ranking
platform where you can vote for your favorite crypto influencers.

As detailed in our recent blog post, Secutor is
more than just a leaderboard; it's a testament to the power of the Pactus
community and the ease of building on our platform. If you haven't already,
check it out and cast your vote!

### Closing Note

With Pagu reaching more users, Wrapto building bridges, and Secutor
demonstrating the power of community builders, November was a pivotal month.
We are excited to carry this momentum into December and the new year.

Thank you for your continued support and participation.
