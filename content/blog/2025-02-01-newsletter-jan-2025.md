## Pactus Highlights

Welcome to the January 2025 edition of the Pactus Newsletter.
This month marks a special milestone: our first anniversary.
Over the past year, we’ve achieved incredible feats, from onboarding thousands of validators to
releasing seven major updates.
As we celebrate our journey so far, we’re thrilled to share the latest highlights from January.
Let’s dive into the updates!

### Reflecting on Our First Year

On January 24th 2025 we celebrated our first anniversary!
The past year has been filled with achievements, including onboarding over 4,000 validators,
implementing gas-less transactions, and releasing seven major updates.
These milestones are a testament to the resilience of our team and the unwavering support of our community.
As we celebrate this anniversary, we’re not slowing down, there’s much more to build, improve, and achieve together.

### Milestone Achievement - 3 Million Blocks

Pactus has reached a significant milestone, surpassing 3 million blocks on our blockchain,
showcasing the commitment of its community and development team.
This accomplishment symbolizes trust and progress in the decentralized ecosystem.

From our inception, Pactus has aimed to revolutionize decentralized solutions,
and this milestone reinforces our unstoppable momentum.
It’s your belief that has made this possible! As we celebrate, we look forward to a future filled with potential,
committed to building an inclusive, decentralized, and energy-efficient blockchain that empowers everyone to thrive.

### Gratitude to Our Community

At the heart of Pactus is our incredible community.
You are the builders and believers, and together, we are reshaping the blockchain space.
Thank you for your trust and support as we continue to pursue our vision of a decentralized future.

### New Year, New Validator Campaign Concluded

To commemorate the first anniversary of our genesis block and the arrival of the new lunar year,
we launched a campaign to onboard new validators to Pactus.
A heartfelt thank you to everyone who took part in our initiative!
We warmly welcome all the new validators to this exciting journey.
Your support is truly invaluable.

### Pagu Update

The Pagu Testnet Faucet is now live on both
[Telegram](https://t.me/pactus_pagu_bot) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/H5vZkNnXCu),
allowing users to easily obtain testnet tokens.
To receive your tokens instantly, simply use the command: `/phoenix/faucet`.
We encourage you to start building and testing, and we welcome your feedback.

### Team Expansion

We are excited to welcome our new Chief Marketing Officer (CMO).
Fahad, from Turkey, has a strong background as the Marketing Manager and advisor at Titled and
as the Director of Investment at Unidef.
His extensive experience in campaigns and marketing strategy will help enhance the visibility of Pactus.
Additionally, we are onboarding more team members, including a Content Team Lead, Business Development Manager,
and Market Analyst, to strengthen our marketing and business team.
If you feel you have what it takes to fill any of these positions please get in contact on info@pactus.org.

### Releasing Version 1.7.0 (Seoul)

On January 23, 2025, [Pactus Version 1.7.0 (Seoul)](https://pactus.org/2025/01/23/pactus-1.7.0-seoul-released/)
released. The most notable addition is the notification service, which enables seamless and
high-performance event tracking for Pactus nodes.
This service allows third-party applications to subscribe to events such as transactions and block confirmations,
ensuring real-time updates.
Furthermore, this notification system will serve as the event provider for the upcoming
smart contract platform, enhancing its ability to react dynamically to blockchain events.
If you haven't upgraded your node yet, now is the time to update it to the latest version.

### Batch Transactions on the Way

Currently, transactions in Pactus contain only one payload.
[PIP-37](https://pips.pactus.org/PIPs/pip-37) proposes to
support multiple payloads without altering the existing structure.
This update will allow users to include multiple payloads in a single transaction.
For example, they will be able to bond all their validators in one transaction.
This feature is particularly important for some dApps that require atomic transactions,
where all payloads must be committed together or none at all.

PIP-37 is currently under active discussion within the development team and
will soon be integrated into the Pactus source code.
