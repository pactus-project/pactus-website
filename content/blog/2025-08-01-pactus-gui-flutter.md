## Overview

We're excited to announce the first public release of the New Pactus GUI, built with
[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) to deliver a beautiful, cross-platform experience for Pactus users!
This early version represents a major leap forward in making blockchain interaction more accessible to everyone.

## Why Flutter?

We chose Flutter for several key reasons:

- Cross-platform compatibility - Runs seamlessly on Windows, macOS and Linux (with mobile coming later!)
- Beautiful, native-performance UI - Smooth animations and responsive interfaces
- Rapid development cycles - Allows us to implement features and fixes faster

## Current Feature Highlights

This initial release includes:

- ✅ Basic node setup and management
- ✅ Dashboard with network overview
- ✅ Wallet and validator information display
- ✅ Settings configuration panel

All wrapped in a modern, intuitive interface that works across desktop platforms.

## We've completed

- Phase 1: Basic Node Setup
- Phase 2: Dashboard Foundation
- Phase 3: Node Testing

Currently working on Phase 4:

- 🔧 Lightweight node installation
- 🔧 gRPC package publishing
- 🔧 Enhanced UI during sync
