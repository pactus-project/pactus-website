## A Year of Growth, Innovation, and Community Power

As we close out 2025, it's time to celebrate what's been an absolutely
remarkable year for Pactus. While 2024 gave us our foundation with the Mainnet
launch and zero-fee transactions, 2025 was the year everything came alive. We
didn't just add features, we built an ecosystem. And if this year taught us
anything, it's that 2026 is going to be even bigger.

## The Technical Evolution

Let's start with the nerdy stuff but we'll keep it simple, promise!

In January, we rolled out v1.7.0 "Seoul," which introduced a
**[notification service](https://pips.pactus.org/PIPs/pip-36)** that lets
developers build apps that actually respond to what's happening on the
blockchain in real-time. Think of it like turning on notifications for your
favorite app, except this time it's for blockchain events. This was the first
step toward the smart contract platform we're building.

Then September came around with v1.9.0 "Lisbon," and this was huge. We pulled
off Pactus's first-ever
**[protocol upgrade](https://pactus.org/2025/09/15/pip-43-activated-reward-split-successfully-implemented/)**.
The network upgraded seamlessly without a single hiccup. For those wondering
what a "protocol upgrade" means: imagine updating the entire rules of a game
while thousands of people are playing it, and nobody even notices. That's
exactly what we did.

October brought v1.10.0 "Casablanca" with even more performance improvements
and reliability features. Each release made running a Pactus node smoother,
faster, and more efficient.

But the real crown jewel? PIP-43.

## PIP-43: Democracy in Action

In August, the Pactus community did something historic. We passed
**[PIP-43](https://pips.pactus.org/PIPs/pip-43)**, our first community-driven
protocol upgrade. This wasn't just a technical change, it was proof that
decentralized governance actually works.

Here's what PIP-43 did: it adjusted how block rewards are distributed. Now, 70%
goes to validators (0.7 PAC per block) and 30% goes to the Pactus Foundation
Treasury (0.3 PAC per block). The old system would have run out of
sustainability in about 14 years. With PIP-43, we've extended that by over 10
additional years.

We also consolidated the Foundation and Team Operations accounts into one
unified Treasury, making everything more transparent and easier to track.

The beauty of PIP-43 isn't just what it changed—it's how it happened. The
community proposed it, debated it, and voted on it. No central authority forced
it. No closed-door meetings. Just pure, democratic blockchain governance.
Satoshi Nakamoto once said, *"I think this is the first time we're trying a
decentralized, non-trust-based system."*
**[Source](https://blockchain.news/Quotes)**. That spirit is exactly what
PIP-43 represents.

## The Network Keeps Growing

As of right now, Pactus has over 5,000 active validators securing the network.
In October alone, 130 new validators joined. Every single one of these
validators is someone who believed in what we're building and decided to be
part of it.

The network is faster than ever. Transactions now process in under 10 seconds.
We hit a major milestone, achieving 100 transactions per second. And back in
March, we surpassed 10 million total transactions on the network.

Think about that for a second. Ten million transactions. Each one representing
someone choosing to use Pactus, trusting the network, and participating in this
decentralized future we're building together.

## Tools That Actually Work

One of the biggest achievements in 2025 was making Pactus accessible to
everyone, not just blockchain experts.

We published JavaScript, Python, Rust and several SDKs. For developers, this
was game-changing. Instead of wrestling with complicated blockchain protocols,
they can now integrate Pactus into their apps using familiar programming
languages. Dart packages are coming soon, too.

The Pactus Web Wallet launched in phases throughout the year, starting in
April, giving users a simple, intuitive way to manage their PAC without
downloading any software. You can create wallets, recover them, check balances,
and manage multiple accounts all from your browser.

## Community-Built Innovation

Here's where 2025 really shined. The community didn't just use Pactus—they
built on it.

Secutor launched in November, still in Beta and it's honestly one of the
coolest things to come out of the ecosystem.

Pagu Bot evolved into something incredible. It started as a simple blockchain
bot, but now it's available on WhatsApp, Discord, and Telegram. You can
literally interact with the Pactus blockchain through a chat message. Send PAC,
check balances, monitor the network—all from apps you already use every day.

And Wrapto? This deserves special recognition. What started as a grant-funded
project is now the **[official Pactus bridge](https://wrapto.app/)**. In 2025,
Wrapto surpassed 100,000 PAC in reserves, proving that the community trusts it
for cross-chain transfers. It now supports in-wallet bridge functionality,
meaning you can move assets between chains without ever leaving your Pactus
wallet. This is essential infrastructure for DeFi, and it's only going to grow.

(Quick aside: Remember when moving crypto between blockchains felt like
defusing a bomb? Yeah, Wrapto made that ancient history.)

## Getting PAC Into Your Hands

September was a breakthrough month for accessibility. Pactus got listed on
**[CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pactus/)**, which is
basically like getting your blockchain into the global phonebook. Suddenly,
anyone searching for crypto projects could find us.

We also launched on **[Coinstore](https://www.coinstore.com/spot/PACUSDT)**,
giving people a centralized exchange option for buying PAC. Combined with our
existing presence on TradeOgre, Azbit, and Uniswap, it's now easier than ever
to get your hands on PAC.

For those who prefer decentralized options, Wrapped PAC (WPAC) is available on
both Uniswap and Binance Smart Chain, making DeFi integration seamless.

We also formed strategic partnerships with SETAI Agents (AI integration),
ATLETA (sports Web3), STRANT (decentralized finance), and Orbler (blockchain
innovation). Each partnership expands what's possible on Pactus.

## The Green Blockchain

Let's talk about something that matters: sustainability. Pactus runs on a
Raspberry Pi Zero, consuming just 0.7 watts of power. That's 99.9% less energy
than Proof-of-Work blockchains like Bitcoin.

We also introduced pruned node support, meaning you can run a node by
downloading just the last 10 days of blockchain data instead of the entire
history. Less storage, less energy, same security.

Blockchain doesn't have to burn down the planet. Pactus proves it.

## Looking Ahead to 2026

If 2025 was about expansion, 2026 is about transformation.

In Q1, we're implementing on-chain governance, adding secp256k1 curve support
(which was planned in November 2025), and launching a mobile-friendly GUI to
make Pactus even more accessible.

Q2 and Q3 will bring the big stuff: a decentralized storage platform, the
Pactus Virtual Machine (PVM) for smart contracts, and a browser extension for
Web3 interactions. These aren't just features—they're building blocks for a
fully decentralized internet.

By Q4 2026, we're targeting a decentralized domain name system and a
decentralized password manager. Imagine owning your internet identity and your
passwords without trusting any central company. That's the future we're
building.

If 2025 was the year Pactus proved it works, 2026 will be the year we prove it
can change everything.

## What Makes Pactus Special

Let's be clear about what we're doing here. Pactus isn't trying to be the
fastest blockchain or the one with the flashiest marketing. We're building
something that actually matters: a blockchain that's accessible, sustainable,
and genuinely decentralized.

You get up to two zero-fee transactions daily. Transactions confirm in under 10
seconds. You don't need to delegate your stake, anyone can validate. You can
stake anywhere from 1 to 1000 PAC, meaning participation isn't just for the
wealthy. The entire network runs on 0.7 watts of power. And the community
drives every major decision through governance.

This is what blockchain was supposed to be.

## Thank You

None of this happens without you. Not the validators securing the network. Not
the developers building apps. Not the community members sharing the vision.
Every single person who believed in Pactus made 2025 possible.

As we celebrated our
**[first anniversary](https://pactus.org/2025/01/24/pactus-at-one-from-dream-to-reality/)**
in January 2025, we looked back at what we'd accomplished. Now, as we close
out the year, we're not just celebrating the past, we're building the future.

2026 is going to be wild. More validators, more applications, more innovation,
more people discovering what decentralized technology can really do.

**HAPPY NEW YEAR.**
