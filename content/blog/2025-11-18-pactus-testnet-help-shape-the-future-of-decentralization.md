Decentralization isn’t built in a day, it’s tested, refined,
and strengthened by the community that believes in it.
That’s where the **Pactus Testnet** comes in.
Running a validator on Testnet is one of the most impactful ways you can
contribute to the growth and resilience of the Pactus blockchain.

In this post, we’ll walk through what Testnet is, why it matters, how to
join, and what it means for the entire ecosystem when you do.

## Why is Testnet Important?

The Testnet is a parallel blockchain environment that mimics the real Pactus mainnet.
It allows developers, validators, and community members to experiment
with features, upgrades, and governance decisions in a **risk-free** space.

Simply put, **Testnet is where innovation meets reliability.** It is
where we test the future before it becomes reality.

**Running a Testnet ensures that:**

* Protocol upgrades (like forks, governance changes, and reward models)
are tested safely.
* Developers can study network behavior under real conditions without
risking user funds.
* Bugs, performance issues, or inefficiencies can be caught early.
* The community has a voice in shaping the blockchain’s evolution.

Every validator who runs Testnet strengthens this feedback loop, making
Mainnet safer and more trustworthy.

## Who can run a test validator node?

**Anyone**, including developers, blockchain enthusiasts, and community
supporters alike. **No advanced coding is required**, if you can follow
step-by-step instructions, you can run a testnet node.
The Testnet is open to both new and existing users, and we especially
encourage past runners who paused to rejoin, your experience helps make
the network stronger.

## Do I Need a New Computer or Special Software?

No you don’t. Running a Pactus Testnet node is simple and lightweight.
You don’t need a new machine, expensive hardware, or even separate
software.
The **same Pactus Software** you already use for Mainnet can also
connect to the Testnet with just a few clicks.

Technically, you can run up to 32 validators in your node, sacrificing
one for testnet is as good as it can be. All you have
to do is to upgrade to the current or recent version available.
Follow the [Testnet guide](https://docs.pactus.org/tutorials/pactus-testnet) and
monitor testnet activities live on [Phoenix Explorer](https://phoenix.pacviewer.com/).

## Where Do I Get Test Tokens?

To interact with the Pactus Testnet, you’ll need test coins **(tPAC)**.
You can request up to 5 **tPAC** per day from [Pagu](https://pagu.bot),
in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/fEdJj84uxZ) / [Telegram chat](https://t.me/pactuschat).
This makes it easy to experiment with sending transactions.

## A Call to Validators and Community Members

We’re calling on all validators and community members to set up a Testnet
node today. You don’t need additional or high-end hardware, and you can
run it right from the same Pactus software you already use.
Every validator strengthens the network, supports decentralization, and
helps developers test upgrades before they reach Mainnet.

## What It Means When You Run Testnet

When you participate in Testnet, you’re not just “testing software.” You’re helping:

* Developers analyze real-world network performance.
* Ensure upgrades like PIP proposals and forks roll out safely.
* Build confidence in the blockchain before mainnet changes go live.

Your contribution helps protect users, strengthen decentralization, and
accelerate adoption.

## Benefits of Joining Testnet

When you run a Testnet node, you’re not just testing; you’re playing a
direct role in governance and innovation.
You help **strengthen the security and credibility** of
Pactus while learning hands-on how blockchain infrastructure really works.

## Join the Pactus Testnet Today

Decentralization thrives when the community is active, and this is one of
the simplest yet most meaningful ways to contribute.
If you’re ready to get started, the [Pactus Testnet Documentation](https://docs.pactus.org/tutorials/pactus-testnet)
walks you through everything you need to know.

You can also learn more about what a
[Testnet](https://pactus.org/2023/03/31/what-is-testnet) is, read the
full [Phoenix Testnet announcement](https://pactus.org/2024/03/16/pactus-permanent-phoenix-testnet-launched),
or track activity live through the [Phoenix Explorer](https://phoenix.pacviewer.com).
And if you ever get stuck, don’t worry, the team is always ready to help
through Discord tickets.

Together, we can keep Pactus secure, sustainable, and truly community driven.
