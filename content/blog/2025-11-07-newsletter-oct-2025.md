## Pactus Highlights

October was another milestone month for Pactus full of progress, partnerships, and community energy.
From welcoming new validators to launching key collaborations, the network keeps growing stronger, more open,
and more resilient.

### Expanding the Validator Network

One of October's biggest moments was the Validator Campaign,
inviting new community members to help secure and decentralize the Pactus network.

The response was incredible—over 130 validator spots were claimed within days,
demonstrating the community's strong confidence in Pactus.
This campaign provides participants with an easy way to become active contributors,
earn rewards, and help shape the network's future.

If you missed the campaign, don't worry—it's still live!
Check out the [Pagu bot](https://pagu.bot) and participate in the campaign today.

### Pactus 1.10.0 "Casablanca" Released

October also brought the release of Pactus 1.10.0 "Casablanca",
a major update that introduces significant improvements to wallet recovery, user experience, and developer tools.

The standout feature of this release is [PIP-41: Address Recovery](https://pips.pactus.org/PIPs/pip-41),
which automatically restores previously used wallet addresses when recovering a wallet.

The update also includes several bug fixes general improvements
to enhance stability and user experience.

### Partnership Spotlight

We also partnered with [Kyvra Tech](https://www.kyvra.xyz/) under the **FUSION** Program.
Kyvra Tech will build the Pactus Nodes Tracker, an open-source platform that monitors and
visualizes network activity in real time.
The tool will give developers and community members clear insight into node health,
connectivity, and overall network status.

### Community Spotlight: Pactus Unplugged

October’s edition of Pactus Unplugged kept the community conversation flowing —
a relaxed and open session where developers, validators, and users came together to discuss ongoing progress.

This month’s discussion focused on the validator campaign, Kyvra’s new partnership,
and what’s next for the FUSION Program.
It’s an ongoing reminder that decentralization isn’t just technical —
it’s about people, collaboration, and shared vision.

### Closing Note

October proved what’s possible when technology and community grow together.
With Casablanca’s improvements, Kyvra’s open-source work, and new validators joining the network,
Pactus moves into November with strong momentum and shared purpose.
November promises more exciting developments, More Unplugged Conversations for community updates and feedback

Thank you for being part of this journey
together, we’re building a more open, transparent, and community-driven blockchain future.
