## Pactus Highlights

Welcome to the October 2024 edition of our newsletter.
This month has been remarkable with significant achievements,
including our CoinGecko listing and reaching over 4,000 validators!
Let's dive into everything we've accomplished together.

### CoinGecko Listing

We're thrilled to announce that Pactus is now officially listed on
[CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pactus)!
This landmark achievement represents more than just another listing -
it's a significant validation of our project and enhances our visibility in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.
Being featured on one of the most trusted crypto tracking platforms makes Pactus more accessible to
both existing community members and potential new users.

This listing opens up exciting new partnership opportunities and positions us for
even greater exposure in the crypto world.
And yes, we're already setting our sights on CoinMarketCap for the future!

### Validator Network Reaches 4,000 Strong

We've hit another incredible milestone - our mainnet is now powered by over 4,000 validators!
This remarkable growth demonstrates the tremendous trust and commitment our community has in Pactus's vision.
Each validator plays a crucial role in strengthening our network's security, decentralization, and governance structure.
This achievement brings us one step closer to our goal of creating a truly inclusive blockchain ecosystem.
The rapid growth of our validator network showcases the strong foundation we're building together.

### Pagu Launches on Telegram

We're excited to announce the expansion of [Pagu](https://github.com/pagu-project/Pagu/), our dedicated assistant bot,
to Telegram!
This addition makes our community resources more accessible than ever.

### Pactus on Raspberry Pi

We're proud to highlight an impressive community achievement this month -
the successful running a Pactus node on a
[Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero/)!
This accomplishment perfectly demonstrates our commitment to accessibility and efficiency.

Here are the impressive specifications:

* Device: Raspberry Pi Zero
* Total Cost: $29 (including microSD card and housing)
* Power Consumption: 0.7-1W
* Monthly Operating Cost: Less than 1 USD

This setup proves that participating in the Pactus network can be both cost-effective and environmentally conscious,
truly embodying our mission of making blockchain accessible to everyone!

### Version 1.5.0 (Singapore) Release

We successfully launched
[Pactus v1.5.0 (Singapore)](http://pactus.org/2024/10/08/pactus-1.5.0-singapore-released/),
featuring the integration of the Ed25519 cryptographic curve.
This significant upgrade went live at block 2,320,000,
enhancing our compatibility with third-party applications, particularly mobile wallets,
while improving overall network performance.

### TPS Performance Breakthrough

We're excited to announce that our latest Testnet performance tests have achieved
an impressive [100 transactions per second](http://pactus.org/2024/10/25/pactus-reaches-100-tps/)!
This testing was conducted under conditions that mirror our Mainnet environment,
indicating that similar performance levels can be expected on our production network.
These results demonstrate our blockchain's robust scalability potential.

### Gas-less Transactions Development

Our team is making significant progress on implementing a new
[consumption fee model](https://pips.pactus.org/PIPs/pip-31) that
will enable gas-less transactions. This innovative feature is scheduled for
our next major update and represents another step toward making blockchain technology more accessible to everyone.
We hope you share our excitement about October's achievements.
As always, your feedback and support drive our continuous improvement.
