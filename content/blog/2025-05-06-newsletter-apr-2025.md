### Pactus Packages for Developers

As Pactus continues to grow, there is increasing demand from individuals, merchants, and organizations
to interact with the Pactus blockchain.
Although the [Pactus API](https://docs.pactus.org/api/) is well-documented and easy to integrate,
to make integration even simpler and more structured,
Pactus RPC packages have been published:

- [pactus-grpc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pactus-grpc) for JavaScript developers.
- [pactus-grpc](https://pypi.org/project/pactus-grpc) for Python developers.
- [pactus-jsonrpc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pactus-jsonrpc) for JavaScript developers.
- [pactus-jsonrpc](https://pypi.org/project/pactus-jsonrpc) for Python developers.

These packages make it easier for both Python and JavaScript applications to integrate with Pactus blockchain.
Packages for other languages, such as Rust and Dart, will be available soon.
