is now available for download.
This release includes the following applications:

- [Pactus GUI](https://docs.pactus.org/get-started/pactus-gui/):
  The graphical user interface (GUI) for the Pactus node that is suitable
  for both beginners and experienced users.

- [Pactus Daemon](https://docs.pactus.org/get-started/pactus-daemon/):
  The command-line interface (CLI) for the Pactus node that is suitable for experienced users.

- [Pactus Shell](https://docs.pactus.org/tutorials/pactus-shell/):
  The command-line tool that allows users to interact with a Pactus node.

- [Pactus Wallet](https://docs.pactus.org/tutorials/pactus-wallet/):
  The wallet software that allows users to manage their wallet and send transactions
  without the need to sync the entire blockchain.

## Highlights

### Zero-Fee Transactions

The Mumbai version introduces zero-free transactions.
The fees for these transactions are calculated based on
the consumption-based fee model discussed in [PIP-31](https://pips.pactus.org/PIPs/pip-31).
To send transactions with no fees, please upgrade your node to this version.
However, there are some limitations for sending zero-free transactions:

- Each address can send about two free transactions daily,
- The confirmation time for zero-fee transactions is longer.

The fee configuration in Pactus is not deterministic,
as each validator sets its own preferences to collect transactions with adjusted values.
We encourage validators with sufficient resources to
change their configurations to accept zero-fee transactions.
The suggested values for supporting zero-free transactions are:

```toml
  [tx_pool.fee]
    fixed_fee = 0 # PAC
    daily_limit = 360 # Bytes
    unit_price = 0.000005 # PAC
```

### Single Reward Address

Starting with the Mumbai version, only one reward address will be created for all validator addresses.
This is a behavioral change in how nodes start.
If a reward address is not set in the config, the application will attempt to
retrieve the first account address from the wallet and use it as the reward address.

### Docker Multi-Platform Support

Pactus [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/pactus/pactus/tags)
now supports multiple platforms, including Linux-amd, Linux-arm64, and others.
Users who need to run Pactus on different platforms can now use
the Pactus Docker images for their specific environments
