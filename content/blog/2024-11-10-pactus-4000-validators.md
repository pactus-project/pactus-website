The Pactus network has surpassed **4,000 active validators**,
a testament to the strength and trust of our growing community.
With every new validator, the Pactus network becomes more secure and resilient,
creating a stable foundation that supports wider adoption and greater community involvement.

## Building a Blockchain for All

As Pactus scales to new heights, we remain dedicated to our mission of creating a blockchain that is accessible,
transparent, and efficient for all.
This milestone not only reflects the incredible progress made but also sets the stage for future growth and innovation.
