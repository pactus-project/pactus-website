Hello Pactus Community, we've got some exciting news to share with you today.
The Pactus ecosystem just welcomed its first community developed app.
[Secutor](https://secutor.world/), a decentralized ranking platform that's
already turning heads.

## What is Secutor

Secutor is a community driven leaderboard where you can vote for your
favorite crypto influencer and help them climb the rankings. Think of it
like CoinMarketLeague or similar platforms, but instead of voting for
altcoins, you're supporting the people who make our community great.

**Here's how it works:** Nominate, vote for your favorite influencer, invite
others to support them too, watch them climb the leaderboard, and earn
rewards if they reach the top. It's simple, fun, and completely
powered by Pactus.

## Why This Matters

This wasn’t built by a corporate team, it was created by real members of the
Pactus community, proving that anyone can launch meaningful projects on
our platform. The development was fast, straightforward,
and free from unnecessary complexity. That’s the strength of a technology
stack that actually works.

When communities start building real products, it's a sign of healthy momentum.
Secutor proves that Pactus isn't just a concept it's a platform where real
innovation happens.

## You Can Build Your Own App

The Pactus community offers SDKs in
[Python](https://pypi.org/project/pactus-sdk/) and
[GRPC](https://crates.io/crates/pactus-grpc),
[JSON](https://crates.io/crates/pactus-jsonrpc) both in Rust programming
languages, making it easy for builders to create and integrate their
own projects. And here's what's impressive—Secutor was built even before
smart contracts are available on Pactus.

That's right. While we're working on rolling out smart contracts soon,
developers are already creating real applications.
This proves that Pactus is truly lightweight and accessible.
You don't need to wait for complex features to start building.

Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, the tools are
here. Anyone in the ecosystem can become part of the bigger picture.

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning. Secutor opens the door for even more utility
apps, experiments, and innovations to emerge from within our community.

We're excited to see what comes next. Whether it's games, tools, or entirely
new concepts, the builders are here and the ecosystem is moving forward.
