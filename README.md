## Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that uses plain text formatting syntax to convert text into HTML,
making it easy to read and write for web content.

### Linting

Markdown linting helps ensure consistent style and formatting, detects syntax errors, improves readability,
and maintains best practices in Markdown documents.

To lint Markdown files, you can use the `mdl` ([MarkdownLint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint)) command-line tool.
This tool checks your Markdown files against a set of rules and provides feedback on any issues found.

To install `mdl`, first you need to install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).
Once you ensure Ruby installed on your system, you can install `mdl` by running:

```sh
gem install mdl
```

Then you can lint your Markdown files with the following command:

```sh
mdl --style=.mdlrc.rb ./content
```

This command will check all documents in the `content` folder for any linting issues and output them in the terminal.
