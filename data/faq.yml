      q: What does "Pactus" mean?
      a: >
        The word "Pactus" is of Latin origin and means "to agree together", "contract", or "transact".
        In English, the term "Pact" is derived from the Latin word "Pactus".

    - id: unique_blockchain
      q: Is Pactus a copy of any other blockchain?
      a: >
        No, Pactus is not a copy or a derivative of any other blockchain.
        It is a new and unique blockchain protocol that has been designed from scratch.
        The consensus mechanism used in Pactus is unique and specifically created to solve the scalability issue of
        validators in the Proof of Stake blockchains.

    - id: without_ico
      q: Did Pactus have an ICO?
      a: >
        No, Pactus didn't have any ICO or Initial Coin Offering.

    - id: why_develop_pactus
      q: Why was Pactus developed?
      a: >
        Pactus was developed with the goal of scaling blockchain without compromising security and decentralization.
        To achieve this, Pactus utilizes a unique consensus mechanism that
        enables the creation of blocks in just 10 seconds.
        Moreover, Pactus was designed to be more accessible to all users,
        regardless of their technical expertise or financial resources.

    - id: what_pactus_solved
      q: What problems does Pactus solve that other blockchains don't?
      a: >
        Pactus tries to solve several problems faced by other blockchain networks,
        including:
        <br><br>
        <b>Scalability:</b>
        Pactus has a unique consensus mechanism that is specifically designed to address the scalability issue
        without sacrificing the security and decentralization.
        <br><br>
        <b>Accessibility:</b>
        Running a node on Pactus is designed to be more accessible to normal users compared to other blockchains.
        <br><br>
        <b>Storage cost:</b>
        Pactus offers a novel storage solution by allowing users to allocate dedicated storage files,
        reducing storage costs and simplifying the smart contracts.

    - id: pactus_vs_bitcoin
      q: How is Pactus different from Bitcoin?
      a: >
        Pactus and Bitcoin are two different types of blockchain networks.
        While Bitcoin uses a process called "Proof of Work" to secure its network,
        Pactus uses a different method called "Proof of Stake".
        This means that instead of mining, validators are responsible for voting on incoming blocks and
        must hold a certain amount of the network's coin, known as "stake",
        as a security deposit to prevent malicious behavior.

    - id: pactus_vs_ethereum
      q: How is Pactus different from Ethereum?
      a: >
        Pactus and Ethereum are both Proof of Stake blockchains,
        but they differ in their approach to running a validator.
        Running a validator on Ethereum can be challenging and requires 32 Ethereum coins to stake.
        In Pactus, there is no fixed amount for staking.
        Pactus is specifically designed to be more accessible to normal users,
        and you can run the Pactus blockchain on your personal computer with basic hardware.

- title: Validator
  items:
    - id: validators
      q: What are validators?
      a: >
        Validators on Pactus are responsible for processing transactions and creating blocks and, by doing so,
        helping to secure the network and keep it decentralized.
        They use their own coins as a stake to ensure the network's security and
        receive rewards for their contributions.
      more: https://docs.pactus.org/protocol/blockchain/validator/

    - id: unlimited_validators
      q: How many validators does Pactus have?
      a: >
        Pactus is a real Proof of Stake blockchain,
        which means there is no limit on the number of validators in the network.
        However, a committee of 51 validators is responsible for creating blocks.
        It's important to note that the committee members are not fixed and they change over time.
      more: https://docs.pactus.org/protocol/consensus/proof-of-stake/

    - id: min_and_max_stake
      q: What are the minimum and maximum amounts I can stake?
      a: >
        In Pactus, the minimum amount you can stake is 1 coin, and the maximum amount you can stake is 1000 coins.
        If you want to stake more than 1000 coins, you can run a new validator.
        Running multiple validators keeps the network more decentralized and helps maintain its security and stability.
      more: https://docs.pactus.org/protocol/consensus/parameters/

    - id: min_hardware_requirements
      q: What are the minimum hardware requirements?
      a: >
        After thorough testing on multiple machines, we can conclude that the recommended minimum hardware
        requirements are as follows:<br><br>
        <b>VPS (Virtual Private Server):</b><br>
        <ul>
        <li>CPU: 2 physical core</li>
        <li>RAM: 2-4 GB</li>
        <li>Storage: 40 GB (Full Node) or 1 GB (<a href="https://docs.pactus.org/tutorials/pruned-nodes/">Pruned Node</a>)</li>
        <li>Network: stable internet connection with 100 Mbps speed</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <b>PC (Personal Computer):</b><br>
        <ul>
        <li>CPU: 2 physical cores</li>
        <li>RAM: 2-4 GB</li>
        <li>Storage: 40 GB (Full Node) or 1 GB (<a href="https://docs.pactus.org/tutorials/pruned-nodes/">Pruned Node</a>)</li>
        <li>Network: stable internet connection with over 15 Mbps speed</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <b>Note:</b> These specifications have been tested and provide an availability score of over 0.9.
      more: https://pips.pactus.org/PIPs/pip-19

    - id: staking_limit
      q: Why is there a limit for maximum stake?
      a: >
        The limit for the maximum stake per validator enhances decentralization and
        prevents validators from gaining too much power, which could potentially lead them to control the committee.
        The maximum staking limit is part of the consensus parameters and
        can be changed in the future through consensus among the validators.
      more: https://docs.pactus.org/protocol/consensus/parameters/

    - id: multiple_validators
      q: Can I run multiple validators on one computer?
      a: >
        The Pactus software allows you to run up to 32 validators on a single node.
        Running multiple validators may require slightly more memory, but it has no impact on storage,
        and has a negligible effect on CPU and networking usage.
        Running multiple validators on a single node enables users to distribute their stake across multiple validators,
        especially when they want to stake more than the maximum stake per validator.
        This eliminates the need for additional resources and simplifies node management.

    - id: validators_rewarded
      q: How do validators get rewarded?
      a: >
        Once a validator proposes a valid block and it is accepted by the network,
        the validator receives 0.7 coins as a block reward (70% of the total block reward).
        The remaining 0.3 coins (30%) are distributed to the Pactus Foundation.
        The reward is an incentive given to validators for their contribution to the network.
      more: https://docs.pactus.org/protocol/blockchain/incentive

    - id: flat_reward
      q: How much is the block reward in Pactus?
      a: >
        Block reward in Pactus is fixed, and it is always one coin per block.
        However, this reward is now split between the validator and the Pactus Foundation:
        0.7 coins (70%) go to the validator who proposed the block, and 0.3 coins (30%) go to the Pactus Foundation.
        This flat reward scheme helps to ensure simplicity, fairness and better coin distribution.

    - id: coins_per_day
      q: How many PAC coins are generated per day?
      a: >
        Daily, a total amount of 8640 PAC is generated.
        This figure translates to 259,200 every 30 days and 3,153,600 per year.

- title: Consensus
  items:
    - id: how_pactus_works
      q: How does Pactus blockchain work?
      a: >
        Pactus operates with a committee of validators who are responsible for creating new blocks.
        The committee consists of 51 validators, however, the members of the committee change randomly over time.
        Every 10 seconds, a validator in the committee known as the proposer collects all the valid transactions,
        adds them into a block,
        and shares it with other validators in the committee.
        If more than â…” of the stakeholders in the committee attest to the proposed block by signing it,
        the block gets committed and
        all the transactions inside the block will be executed.
        This process repeats every 10 seconds.

    - id: how_enter_committee
      q: How can a validator enter to the committee?
      a: >
        To enter the committee in Pactus, validators participate in a sortition process that occurs at each block.
        In this process, validators generate a provable random number between zero and the total staked coins,
        and if the number is less than their stake, they can send a transaction known as sortition transaction
        with the proof of sortition.
        Once the sortition transaction is included in a block, the validator replaces the oldest committee member.
      more: https://docs.pactus.org/protocol/consensus/sortition/

    - id: proposer_selection
      q: How are block proposers selected in the committee?
      a: >
        The block proposer inside the committee is selected based on the time they entered the committee.
        This means that the selection process follows a first-come, first-propose order.
      more: https://docs.pactus.org/protocol/consensus/committee/

    - id: multiple_committee_entry
      q: Can multiple validators enter the committee at once?
      a: >
        The process of sortition in Pactus is random, so it's possible for more than
        one validator to enter the committee at once,
        or no validator at all. However, on average, one validator should join the committee at each block.
      more: https://docs.pactus.org/protocol/consensus/sortition/

    - id: fork_possibility
      q: Is it possible to have two valid blocks at the same time?
      a: >
        It is not possible to have two valid blocks at the same time in Pactus blockchain.
        The consensus algorithm in Pactus prevents the possibility of having two block proposers at the same time.
        This ensures that there will be no fork in the network.
      more: https://docs.pactus.org/protocol/consensus/protocol/

    - id: block_confirmation
      q: How much is the block confirmation in the Pactus Blockchain?
      a: >
        Block confirmation refers to the number of blocks that need to be created
        before a transaction is considered final and irreversible. In Pactus, block confirmation is immediate,
        meaning that once a transaction is added to a block, it is considered confirmed and cannot be reversed.

    - id: treasury_account
      q: What is the Treasury account?
      a: >
        The Treasury account is a special account in Pactus blockchain that
        holds the block rewards coins.
        It has no key pair associated with it, meaning it cannot be accessed or controlled by anyone.
        Every time a block is created, one coin from the Treasury account is distributed as a block reward.

    - id: reward_distribution
      q: How will the block rewards be distributed?
      a: >
        Every 10 seconds, one coin from the Treasury account is distributed as a block reward.
        This process is called "coin minting".
        As a result, the total number of Pactus coins in circulation gradually
        increases over time as new blocks are added to the blockchain.
        Every day, 8,640 coins are minted, resulting in approximately 3 million coins being minted annually
        by the Treasury account.

    - id: reward_split
      q: What is the reward split mechanism?
      a: >
        The reward split mechanism, introduced in PIP-43, modifies how block rewards are distributed in Pactus:
        <ul>
          <li><b>70% to Validators:</b> The validator who proposes a block receives 0.7 coins as their reward.</li>
          <li><b>30% to Pactus Foundation:</b> The remaining 0.3 coins are distributed to the Pactus Foundation addresses.</li>
        </ul>
        This mechanism enhances sustainability and trust in the Pactus economy by providing predictable,
        transparent funding for the foundation's operations and ecosystem growth.

    - id: support_distribution
      q: How will the Support coins be spent?
      a: >
        The support coins (VC Allocation and Community) are designed to provide financial backing for the project.
        These allocations serve different purposes within the Pactus ecosystem:
        <ul>
        <li><b>Community (2.1 Million coins - 5%):</b>
          This portion mainly supports the community. As part of this, participants on Testnets receive initial staking coins to
        setup their validator and secure the Mainnet.
        The community allocation mostly spends through the [Pagu](https://pagu.bot) bot.
        </li>
        <li><b>Venture Capital Allocation (6.3 Million coins - 15%):</b>
          This portion is set aside for any potential venture capitalists who
          might show interest in investing in the project.
        </li>
        </ul>
        Transparency is a key aspect of this allocation, as all movements of these
        coins are trackable due to the fully transparent nature of the blockchain.
